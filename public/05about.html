    <p>As a project manager at Fisker, I am responsible for ensuring the service readiness and quality of third-party
        service suppliers and mobile service units. With over 12 years of experience in the automotive industry, I have
        developed strong competencies in warranty administration, data analysis, customer satisfaction, and team
        management. <br>
        I am passionate about learning new things and applying my know-how to solve complex challenges and deliver
        innovative solutions. I have leveraged my skills and certifications in Microsoft Power Automate and LinkedIn
        Learning to streamline workflows, automate tasks, and enhance my professional development. My mission is to
        drive service excellence at Fisker and contribute to its vision of creating sustainable and accessible mobility.
        <br>
        Wright now I am focusing on learning new skills like web development and Google Ads. So if you want to give me a
        chance to further develop these skills, I would appreciate it a lot.
