    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Dear visitor, <br><br>
        
        You are now visiting my very first webpage. It has been created out of the need of practicing some basic webdevelopment skills that I have recently acquired. Another reason for creating this website is that of promoting myself.
        So feel free to browse (it is not much now, but I am sure it will eventually grow) and use the Contact section to send me feedback. I am open to any suggestions and all feedback would be much appreciated.

        If you find the information on this website useful, please contact me and let us see how we can work together.

        Thank you and happy browsing. 
        <br><br>
        Best regards, <br>
        Andrei
